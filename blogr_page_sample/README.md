## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow then Mobile
- Vanilla JS for mobile navigation toggle

### What I learned

The dropdown menu is the highlight of my learning while working through this project. This is something I have never worked on before and had no prior knowledge how to go about it. I had to do a little research (Stackover flow to the rescue... lol). At the end, I was a able to complete the dropdown menu using just HTML and CSS- no JS.

I faced a little challenge having a background color and a background image for a parent container. Below is a code snippet of how I was able to achieve it.

```css
.header{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    position: relative;
    background: url(images/bg-pattern-intro.svg);
    background-position: center;
    background-size: 150%;
    padding: 4rem 10rem;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 6rem;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-color: hsl(353, 100%, 62%);
}
```

### Continued development

While working through this project, I noticed I still needed to perfect using JS for mobile navigation toggle. I believe I can make a smoother transition for the mobile navigation toggle. So, I'll be working on that for the next couple of days.
